**Please note** that the following models are **discontinued**:

- **V1.6**

## V2 & V2.5 Version Differences:

**V2 TB** - Sound wise, V2 is not that bad and support EQ adjustment. The shell is firmer and support firmware updates - future proof.

**V2.5** - Known for having better ANC,  transparency should be better as well. Better headband than V2, market as support firmware update but haven't received any firmware updates.
