# Connectivity

Understanding the connectivity of AirPods replicas can help you make an informed purchasing decision.

## iOS Popup

The iOS popup appears almost instantly on some AirPods replicas, although the speed may vary based on the seller and batch. In some cases, the popup may appear faster than on original AirPods.

## macOS Connectivity

Newer clones work flawlessly with macOS, wheras this was not the case with previous models. We recommend choosing the "TB" model, if you plan on using your Apple AirPods replicas with your MacBook or iMac.

## Range

The range of most AirPods replicas matches that of the original AirPods, around 10 meters. However, obstructions like thick walls can affect this range.

## Latency

Some AirPods replicas may have better latency than original AirPods, resulting in improved audio-video synchronization. Websites like YouTube automatically adjust for latency.

## Multi-Device Connectivity

Currently, no available replicas support connecting to multiple devices at once using iCloud Connect.

::: warning
AirPods replicas do not support multi-device connectivity through iCloud Connect.

## Initial Connectivity with iOS Devices

In some cases, AirPods replicas may not connect to iOS devices initially. However, a fix often exists for this issue. Please refer to the Troubleshooting section for more information.
